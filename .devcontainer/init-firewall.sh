# Watchman devcontainer egress firewall.
#
# Default-deny outbound; allowlists the domains used by:
#   - npm / GitHub for package install
#   - Anthropic API + claude.ai for Claude Code auth
#   - Debian APT mirrors (rebuilds, ad-hoc tooling)
#   - PyPI (in case any tooling pulls Python deps)
#   - VS Code marketplace (for extensions, if you ever attach an editor)
#
# Watchman is a LAN-monitoring tool, so in production it reaches local
# services (Bitcoin node, IPFS, Tor, AdGuard, …) on the home network.
# The devcontainer firewall blocks LAN access by default so a misbehaving
# session can't probe your network — the assumption is that Claude only
# works on code here, and live polling is exercised on the host.
#
# To allow LAN access (e.g. to actually exercise the pollers from inside
# the container), append a CIDR to the ipset:
#   sudo ipset add watchman-allowed 192.168.1.0/24
# or set ALLOWED_CIDRS below.
#
# Localhost traffic is fully allowed so backend and frontend can talk
# to each other on 127.0.0.1.
