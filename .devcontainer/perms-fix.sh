# Image-baked helper that performs ONLY the specific ownership / permission
# repairs the devcontainer needs at start time. It is invoked by the root
# ENTRYPOINT (the container has no sudo — it runs with no-new-privileges, and
# all privileged setup happens in the entrypoint). The repo copy at
# .devcontainer/perms-fix.sh is the source — the Dockerfile COPYs it in
# read-only to dev.
#
# Takes no arguments and performs no operations parameterised by the caller.
